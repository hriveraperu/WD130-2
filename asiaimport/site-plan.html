      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>We are sure you noticed that almost everything is "Made in China". 
          You did ask yourself questions like: How can I contact them? 
          How can I start to import all those products by myself? 
          Difficult task, but we can make it possible! 
          We can help you make contact with different Chinese factories for different cities and industries, 
          you don't need to learn Chinese or negotiate with them, 
          we already do this successfully with many of my customers and help them import what their customers need.
