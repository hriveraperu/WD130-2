    <p> Hi, I am Hugo Rivera from Lima, Perú. I'm married and am father of 2 children, my current job is IT Manager in a law firm here in Perú. 
        I like to watch videos to learn new skills or learn about world's history. 
        I was a Import/Export consulting guy, but pandemic changed my vision in a 180 degrees turn.</p>
    <p> What I love about BYU Idaho is the temporal/spiritual experiences in all the things. 
        I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Applied Technology. I know everything related with programming and internet is very valuable, because
        we are in the breakthrough of Technology in the world because of the pandemic. I will get this information to learn how to create websites, or
        programs that allow the users to get what they want.</p>
    <p> I've been a member of the Church since 2003, my favorite quote is "Fatherhood is leadership, the most important kind of leadership. It has always been so; it always will be so. Father, with the assistance and counsel and encouragement of your eternal companion, you preside in the home. It is not a matter of whether you are most worthy or best qualified, but it is a matter of [divine] appointment." (A Message from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints” By the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles

        December 1973) and my favorite
        scripture is <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.23-24?lang=eng">Mosiah 2:23-24</a>. I am grateful for getting the chance to be wih you all!</p>
